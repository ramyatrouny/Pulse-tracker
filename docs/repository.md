# Repository Pattern Implementation Guide

This guide explains the implementation of the repository pattern in a Node.js application, using MongoDB as the data store. The repository pattern abstracts the data layer, providing a cleaner separation of concerns and an organized way to access the database.

## Concept of Repository Pattern

The repository pattern acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers, using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. This pattern helps in managing data retrieval, persistence, and search logic in a centralized manner.

## Implementing the Repository Pattern

### Prerequisites

- MongoDB driver and type definitions should be installed in the project.
- The repository should be designed to work with specific entities or domain objects in the application.

### Installation

Install MongoDB driver and its type definitions:

```bash
npm install mongodb @types/mongodb
```

### Defining a Repository

1. **Create a Repository Class**: This class should encapsulate all the database operations related to a specific entity or collection.

   Example:

   ```ts
   import { dep } from 'mesh-ioc';
   import { MongoDb } from '@ubio/framework/modules/mongodb';

   export class UserRepository {
   	@dep() private mongodb!: MongoDb;

   	private get collection() {
   		return this.mongodb.db.collection('users');
   	}

   	// Repository methods (e.g., insert, update, delete, find)
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Repository Methods**: Define methods for interacting with the database, such as insert, update, delete, and find.

   Example:

   ```ts
   async insertUser(user: User): Promise<void> {
       await this.collection.insertOne(user);
   }

   async findUserById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
       return this.collection.findOne({ _id: id });
   }

   ```

3. **Using the Repository in Application**: Integrate the repository into the application's service layer to abstract away the data access logic:

   ```typescript
   import { Application } from 'your-framework';
   import { MyService } from './MyService';

   export class App extends Application {
   	createGlobalScope() {
   		const mesh = super.createGlobalScope();
   		mesh.service(UserRepository);
   		return mesh;
   	}
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

Implementing the repository pattern in a Node.js application enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability. It provides a structured approach to data access, making the application more robust and organized.
